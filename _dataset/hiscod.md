Together with [Paul Maneuvrier-Hervieu](https://paulmaneuvrierhervieu.com/), I developed the Historical Social Conflict Database (HiSCoD) which includes protests, riots, and other forms of social conflict. HiSCoD currently includes information on nearly 10,000 social conflict events from the lae 16th century to the 19th century.

Online release very soon...
