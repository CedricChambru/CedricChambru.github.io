The course was composed of 12 sessions of 2 hours each week, for two groups of 30 students. Students were evaluated based on oral presentations and written exams, along with their participation and discussion on the class material. I was also in charge of grading the final exam (130 students).  

I taught this course in spring 2014, spring 2015, fall 2016, fall 2017, and fall 2018.
