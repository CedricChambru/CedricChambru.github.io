The course was composed of 12 sessions of 2 hours each week, for a groups of 20 students. Students were evaluated based on oral presentations and written exams, along with their participation and discussion on the class material. I was also in charge of grading the final exam (65 students).

I taught this course in fall 2013 and fall 2014.
