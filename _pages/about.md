I am a post-doctoral researcher in Economic History at the [University of Zurich](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/researchers/chambru.html). My research spans political economy and economic history. More specifically, my research interest centers on understanding the role of institutions and state-building in long run development. Another strand of my research studies the evolution of living standards during the Industrial Revolution. I also wrote several papers related to colonial history, and I am currently preparing a manuscript, which documents the emergence and properties of the French imperial elites and how they both used and contributed to the formation of the structure of the Empire between 1880 and 1950. Finally, my research interests also include historical social conflict. Since November 2020, I am the co-maintainer of the [Historical Social Conflict Database (HiSCoD)](https://www.unicaen.fr/hiscod/?locale=en).

Prior to joining the University of Zurich, I obtained my PhD at the University of Geneva in 2019. I have been visiting researcher at the University of Caen-Normandie, University of Mohammed VI Polytechnique, University of Montreal, University of Oxford, and Yeungnam University.
