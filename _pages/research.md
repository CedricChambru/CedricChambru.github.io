How do radical reforms of the state shape economic development over time? In 1790, France’s first Constituent Assembly overhauled the kingdom’s organization to set up new administrative entities and local capitals. In a subset of departments, new capitals were chosen quasi-randomly as the Assembly abandoned its initial plan to rotate administrative functions across multiple cities. We study how exogenous changes in local administrative presence affect the state’s coercive and productive capacity, as well as economic development in the ensuing decades. In the short run, proximity to the state increases taxation, conscription, and investments in law enforcement capacity. In the long run, the new capitals and their periphery obtain more public goods and experience faster economic development. One hundred years after the reform, capitals are 40% more populated than comparable cities in 1790. Our results shed new light on the intertemporal and redistributive impacts of state-building in the context of one of the most ambitious administrative reforms ever implemented.

* The Evolution of Wages in Early Modern Normandy (1600–1850) (with [Paul Maneuvrier-Hervieu](https://paulmaneuvrierhervieu.github.io/)) [Working paper](https://doi.org/10.5167/uzh-207639).

This paper presents new estimations of wages for Normandy between 1600 and 1850. We used a vast array of primary and secondary sources to assemble two new databases on wages and commodity prices to establish a new regional consumer price index (CPI) and twelve regional wage series. We posit that the sluggish demographic growth during the 18th century, and the resulting labour shortage, led to a convergence of wages across unskilled occupations and a relative catch-up with urban skilled construction labourers in the years preceding the French Revolution. We also provide tentative evidence suggesting that labourers in stable employment could have earned as much as their English counterparts during this period.

* Do it Right! Leaders, Weather Shocks and Social Conflicts in Pre-Industrial France (1661-1789). [Working paper](https://doi.org/10.5167/uzh-186150)

I use spatial and temporal variation in temperature shocks to examine the effect of adverse weather conditions on the onset of social conflicts in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century France. The paper’s contribution is threefold. First, I document the effect of temperature shocks on standards of living using cross-section and panel prices data. Second, I link highresolution temperature data and a new database of 8,528 episodes of social conflicts in France between 1661 and 1789. I use a linear probability model with subregional and year fixed effects to establish a causal connection between temperature shocks and conflicts. One standard deviation increase in temperature increased the probability of social conflicts by about 5.3 per cent. To the best of my knowledge, these results are the first to quantify the effect of temperature shocks on intergroup conflict in pre-industrial Europe. Finally, I investigate the role of local leaders– the intendants– in the mitigation of temperature shocks. I show that leaders with higher level of local experience were better able to cope with adverse weather conditions. I argue that years of local experience were a key determinant in the intendant’s ability to administer efficiently his province. This interpretation is supported by historical evidence.

* The Legacy of Colonial Education: Evidence from Tunisia (with [Mhamed Ben Salah](https://mhamedbensalah.github.io/) and [Maleke Fourati](https://sites.google.com/view/malekefourati))[Draft available upon request]

This paper uses spatial variations in exposure to colonial public primary education to study the long-term effect on education outcomes in Tunisia. We assemble a new data set on the location of schools with the number of pupils and teachers by origin, along with population data during the French protectorate (1881–1956). We match those with existing contemporary data on education at both district and individual level. We find that the exposure of local population to colonial public primary education has overall a longlasting effect on educational outcomes, even when controlling for colonial investments in education. A one per cent increase in Tunisian enrolment rate in 1931 is associated with a 1.69 percentage points increase in literacy rate in 2014. We find that this effect is entirely driven by older generations, as there is no significant impact on literacy rate and the propensity to graduate from primary school for individuals who attended primary schools after the 1989/91 reform. We posit that the efforts undertook by the Tunisian government after independence to promote schooling finally paid off after 40 years and overturn the effects of history
